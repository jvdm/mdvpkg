mdvpkg TODO List
=================

* Decide if cached methods should emit signals or return data.

* Add support for better cache updates, implementing verification of
  changes in entries by package versions.

* Fix documentation to adhere to sphynx

* Automate synchronization of status variables between backend and
  tasks.py

* Decide how to report back to clients the number of packages in list
  by status -- try no to use Ready signal since it can be used by
  different cached results, and not just packages.
